Temporal quantization is performed in beat space by mapping each note
independently to a fixed-resolution beat grid, rather than normalizing
over the total duration or total number of beats of the piece.

A 1/32-beat quantization strikes a balance between temporal resolution and
model complexity, preserving expressive timing in slow-tempo pieces while
avoiding spurious micro-timing noise.
